A global news and data tracking application (Android, iOS, and Progressive Web Application) that allows for getting trending news (according to trending topics on Twitter) relevant to user location as well as up-to-date access to global information from reputable sources.

    ->Link to iOS apps (iPhone and iPad) on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/incite-news/id1516091260

    ->Link to incite on the web (PWA): https://incite.news

First version of the app to use NewsAPI.org to get news articles. Trending Topics functionality to be implemented in the future.

First version to also feature  Covid-19 cases tracking page providing users with a quick overview of the related data.

NB: Please note that due to the regulations on the Google PlayStore and App Store (Apple) which restricts publication of apps that show health related data, the functionality offered on the incite app has been dialed down to only the news tabs (excludes the Covid-19 cases tracker) as shown in the 'compliant branch' on Github. However, the code for the fully functioning App that can still be found on the 'master branch' on Github.

Also please note that the PWA (or the web version of Incite) is now LIVE (https://incite.news) and offers the Covid-19 Tracking functionality. However, as the Flutter Web Framework is yet to release a stable version with full support for the Web, the Incite web app may still experience difficulties providing the full services (especially in the Trending, and Local news tabs)..

In short: On Android and iOS - Covid-19 tracking had to be muted, Trending, and Local news is functional. On Web, News is not fully functional, but Covid-19 tracking is fully functional.
